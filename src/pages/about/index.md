## Present

I'm a London based web developer for a company called [Monzo](https://monzo.com). We're building the best bank on the planet.

### Past

Before I was a freelance writer, who did a spot of music journalism and dabbled with undercover investigations.



Before that I graduated in Psychology from UCL, with a focus on psychopharmacology in my final year.



Before that I wanted to go live in Vancouver and study humpback whales.



### Future

Here are some things I would like to do:

*  Work remotely from somewhere with fresher air than London
* Do a Vipassana retreat, take apart my brain and put it back together again
* Write a sci-fi novel
